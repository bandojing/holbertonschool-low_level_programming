This is the readme for 0x06 pointers arrays strings I've been struggling a bit
with pointers, pointer notation and how to use them but after today
because of some help from others in the cohort things have become a bit
more clear. I will work in this section to use more pointer notation
and maybe even alternate versions of the same functions that use
pointers more instead of arrays and array notation.
